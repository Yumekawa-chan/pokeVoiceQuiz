I've crafted the perfect CLI quiz app for all you Pokémon cry enthusiasts out there! 

One day, I'll bring it to the web too. 🌐

## How To Use?

First, let's get your environment set up. Add `ffmpeg` to your PATH. 📦

1. **Install Pokémon cries:**
   ```sh
   python getPokemonSounds.py

This will download all the Pokémon cries for you. 🎶

2. **Run the quiz app:**
   ```sh
   python main.py

## To Conclude

Sorry folks, the quiz is currently in Japanese only. 

No plans for an English version yet! 😅

If you have fun, don't forget to give it a ⭐!
